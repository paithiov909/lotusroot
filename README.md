This package implements a parsnip engine of
[dmolitor/glmSparse](https://github.com/dmolitor/glmSparse).

> The goal of glmSparse is to provide common methods such as `coef`,
> `summary`, `predict`, `broom::tidy`, etc. for sparse GLMs implemented
> in the
> [MatrixModels](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MatrixModels/index.html)
> package. For more information on this particular implementation of
> GLMs, see the documentation for `MatrixModels::glm4`. Additionally,
> glmSparse extends `MatrixModels::glm4` to allow the user to both fit
> GLMs using the formula syntax of base Râ€™s `glm` function as well as
> directly passing in a pre-formulated sparse model matrix and response
> vector (sparse matrices as defined by the `Matrix` package
> implementation).
